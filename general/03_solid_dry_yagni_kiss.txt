- SOLID - set of principles for writing clean code

1) Single Responsibility (SRP) - Focused Purpose
A class should have a single responsibility (keep things focused)
Primarily targets classes and methods, ensuring each does only one specific job
Example: LoginHelper only manages login steps, LogoutHelper manages only logout steps

2) Open-Closed (OCP) - Extendable Code
Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification (make it easy to add, not change)
Focuses on classes and interfaces, making them extendable but closed for modification
Example: LoginHelper can be extended to handle new actions without changing the original LoginHelper

3) Liskov Substitution (LSP) - Compatible Replacement
Children replace their parents without breaking code (child class should be able to stand in for its parent)
Primarily for classes and interfaces, allowing child classes to be used interchangeably with parent classes
Example: LoginPage class that has the same methods as a BasePage, so replacing LoginPage with BasePage doesn’t break your test

4) Interface Segregation (ISP) - Specialized Interfaces
Prefer smaller, specific interfaces over a large one (don’t overload)
Affects interfaces, avoiding the creation of overloaded interfaces that contain unused methods
Example: use specific page objects for different sections - LoginPage and DashboardPage with avoiding unnecessary functions in each

5) Dependency Inversion (DIP) - Abstract Dependency
Depend on abstractions, not on specific details
Involves classes, interfaces, and properties, promoting reliance on abstractions rather than specific implementations
Example: instead of hardcoding browser configurations, pass a BrowserConfig object to your tests so that any config can be used

SRP relates to Encapsulation by keeping classes focused and self-contained
OCP relates to Inheritance, allowing you to extend behavior without changing existing code
LSP relates to Polymorphism, enabling subclasses to be used interchangeably with their parent class
ISP and DIP relates to Abstraction, making code more modular and flexible by decoupling classes through interfaces and abstract classes


- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) - avoid duplicating code by reusing components
Example: create utility functions for common actions which you can reuse across different tests


- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) - only code what's currently needed
Example: avoid adding extra test data or selectors in page objects until needed for a specific test case


- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) - aim for simplicity in code design
Example: avoid complex assertions and locators, use simple assertions and locators that are easy to understand and maintain
