- Explicit and Implicit waiters
-- Implicit Wait - automatically waits for a set amount of time for elements to appear before throwing an error and applies to all elements
-- Explicit Wait - waits for a specific condition or element for a set time, only when and where you define it

- Soft Assertions
-- Allows tests to continue running even if an assertion fails, collecting all errors to report at the end
-- Multiple issues from one test run instead of stopping at the first failure

- Triple AAA principle - structure for writing tests
-- Arrange - set up the conditions for the test
-- Act - perform the action or behavior youâ€™re testing
-- Assert - check if the result matches what you expected

- Selectors and differences (XPath/CSS)
-- CSS - find elements based on CSS properties (classes, IDs, etc), faster and simpler for standard web elements
-- XPath - path-based selector for locating elements based on their hierarchy in the DOM, useful for complex structures but can be slower
-- Difference - CSS works top-down (from parent to child), XPath works top-down (from parent to child) and bottom-up (from child to parent)
